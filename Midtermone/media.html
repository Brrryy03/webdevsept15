            is an American professional basketball player for the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was named the Rookie of the Year after being selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft. An eight-time All-Star and three-time member of the All-NBA Team, Irving won an NBA championship with the Cavaliers in 2016. He is widely considered one of the best ball handlers of all time
Irving played one year of college basketball for the Duke Blue Devils before joining the Cavaliers in 2011. <mark>He won the Most Valuable
 Player (MVP) award for the 2014 All-Star Game. In the 2016 NBA Finals,</mark> Irving made the championship-winning three-pointer to complete the Cavaliers' historic comeback over the Golden State Warriors. After another Finals appearance in 2017, Irving requested a trade and was dealt to the Boston Celtics. He played with the Celtics for two seasons, after which Irving signed with the Brooklyn Nets as a free agent in 2019. After four seasons with the Nets, he requested a trade and was dealt to the Dallas Mavericks in 2023, where Irving reached his fourth NBA Finals with the team in 2024. He has also played for the United States national team, with which Irving won gold at the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics.

                      After Jayson Tatum’s 2024 NBA Finals prediction on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” Dallas Mavericks star guard Kyrie Irving’s new Instagram profile picture has set social media ablaze. The Boston Celtics defeated the Mavericks in the 2024 NBA Finals, and Tatum predicted a re-match in 2025. 
        Despite leading Finals MVP Jaylen Brown in three major categories, Tatum couldn’t win the award. However, Tatum was asked to predict the next NBA MVP, and with all the humility, he said, “Can I say myself?”
